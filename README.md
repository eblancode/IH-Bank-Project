### ADMINS CAN CREATE ACCOUNTS WHICH MUST HAVE THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS
Savings
* have a default interest rate of 0.0025
* may be instantiated with an interest rate other than the default, with a maximum interest rate of 0.5
* should have a default minimumBalance of 1000
* may be instantiated with a minimum balance of less than 1000 but no lower than 100
CreditCards
* have a default creditLimit of 100
* may be instantiated with a creditLimit higher than 100 but not higher than 100000
* have a default interestRate of 0.2
* may be instantiated with an interestRate less than 0.2 but not lower than 0.1
CheckingAccounts
* When creating a new Checking account, if the primaryOwner is less than 24, a StudentChecking account should be created otherwise a regular Checking Account should be created.
* should have a minimumBalance of 250 and a monthlyMaintenanceFee of 12

### INTEREST AND FEES FUNCTIONALITIES
Interest and Fees should be applied appropriately.

### PenaltyFee
* The penaltyFee for all accounts should be 40.
* If any account drops below the minimumBalance, the penaltyFee should be deducted from the balance automatically

### InterestRate
* Interest on savings accounts is added to the account annually at the rate of specified interestRate per year. That means that if I have 1000000 in a savings account with a 0.01 interest rate, 1% of 1 Million is added to my account after 1 year. When a savings account balance is accessed, you must determine if it has been 1 year or more since either the account was created or since interest was added to the account, and add the appropriate interest to the balance if necessary.
* Interest on credit cards is added to the balance monthly. If you have a 12% interest rate (0.12) then 1% interest will be added to the account monthly. When the balance of a credit card is accessed, check to determine if it has been 1 month or more since the account was created or since interest was added, and if so, add the appropriate interest to the balance.

### ACCOUNT ACCESS
Admins
* Admins should be able to access the balance for any account and to modify it.

AccountHolders
* AccountHolders should be able to access their own account balance
* Account holders should be able to transfer money from any of their accounts to any other account (regardless of owner). The transfer should only be processed if the account has sufficient funds. The user must provide the Primary or Secondary ownerâ€™s name and the id of the account that should receive the transfer.

Third-Party Users
* There must be a way for third-party users to receive and send money to other accounts.
* Third-party users must be added to the database by an admin.
* In order to receive and send money, Third-Party Users must provide their hashed key in the header of the HTTP request. They also must provide the amount, the Account id and the account secret key.

### Extra
Implemented for a better ease-of-use and more accurate simulator

* Unique username and password fields have been implemented in User class to make it easier to work with security authentification.
* Inbound/Outbound transaction list have been implemented in Account class to keep it record of the transactions made
* Fees and Interest methods have been implemented in Account class as a requirement of the same and for a better ease-of-use
